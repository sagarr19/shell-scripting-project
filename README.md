# shell-scripting-project

## Hello everyone! I am Sagar Kanamadi and I am on my way to master DevOps. I have created a basic shell scripting project which will help in listing the users of a particular repository and can also helo in revoking or granting access to a particular user.
## The entire process of manually revoking or granting a user permission is tedious so this script will help in automating the entire process. No matter the amount of repositories, it will list all the users in the organisation and their access permissions.

## Refer the .sh file for thorough understanding of the script
